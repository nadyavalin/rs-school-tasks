        <h2>Scrum</h2>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>The Scrum methodology involves the use of short "sprints", which form the project cycle. These periods last
          from <u>one to two weeks</u> and are designed for teams of no more than <u>10 people.</u></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Kanban</h2>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>In the Kanban methodology, outstanding tasks within a project are represented using <u>visual elements</u>,
          namely
          boards.</p>
        <p>The most common way to do this is to <u>use software</u> that allows you to easily drag and drop boards
          within
          projects, although this is not a requirement.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Lean</h2>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Lean project management methodology aims to reduce waste and create a simple project structure. Ultimately,
          this means being able to do more with fewer resources to improve the efficiency and quality of teamwork.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Initially, loss reduction applied to physical products. Now we are talking about wasteful ways of doing work.
          They are represented by three letters M:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Muda (wastefulness): Ways of working that consume resources but do not create value</li><br>
          <li>Mura (unevenness): Occurs during overproduction and entails losses</li><br>
          <li>Muri (overload): Occurs due to too much strain on resources</li>
        </ol>
