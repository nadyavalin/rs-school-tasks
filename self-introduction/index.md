## Brief-introduction
Hello, my name is Nadezhda Tkachuk. I’m 36 y. o. I’m from Russia, Saint-Petersburg. My hometown is Volgograd, and I have been living in St. Petersburg for 6 years. My profession is a Senior Specialist in Auditing and Monitoring Business Processes.

## Education
I graduated from Volgograd State Technical University as an engineer, specialty «Automation of technological processes» in 2010. I finished design courses last year. I'm learning on Stepik now (I have several certificate from Stepik). Currently I am taking the RS School Front-end course.

## Why I got interested in programming?
At the age of 14, I found a book about HTML. I read it at once. I made several websites, learned a little design, and I even started studying the back-end (PHP, MySQL), but 22 years ago this area wasn't as developed as it is now in terms of learning opportunities and I was stuck in the field of Java Script and PHP. I didn’t have a mentor. And I didn’t even know about their existence. So I gave up at the age of 16, as far as I remember.

All these years I remembered about my lost passion and I thought it’s impossible to rush into this sphere again. But… In December, 2022, I accidently found the design courses. In the first time I saw Figma and it was wonderful. After that course I understood that I need more. I didn't want to design websites, I wanted to code website designs like I did as a teenager.

## What is my purpose of joining RS School?
I want to realize my childhood dream of becoming a programmer. As they say, it's never too late or better late than never.

So now I want to be a Front-end developer because I enjoy programming and I can read and understand documentation properly. I can even prove it to you.

*Show Cross-Check: Submited tasks and stars*

As you can see, all reviewers gave me the high marks. We didn't argue at all. I like to do and complete tasks. I spend all my free time on programming.

## Jobs experience
So now I'm going to tell about my work. My first profession was a Leading Metrology Engineer, then a Quality Specialist and Auditor. These jobs were in Volgograd. Now I am a Senior Specialist in Auditing and Monitoring Business Processes in Saint-Petersburg.

## One of my many duties on my present job is...
checking the websites of the company. As an auditor, I check the relevance of the documentation of our products on the site: design documentation, certificates, data sheets, user manuals, etc. Also I help with Search engine optimization (SEO). I won’t show you these sites because I didn’t create them. I was included in this process only this year I think it happened because I started using my RS School knowledge in my audits.

And now I have a project to create a knowledge base for an organization on Bitrix. I can't show you this too because of commercial secrets.

But I can sheare [my portfolio on Telegram](https://t.me/portfolio_tkachuk) and show you my pet projects.
