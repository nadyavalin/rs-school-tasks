[My self-introduction on YouTube](https://youtu.be/QK9PiiJq5-M)

## Brief-introduction
Hello, my name is Nadezhda Tkachuk. I’m 36 y. o. I’m from Russia, Saint-Petersburg. My hometown is Volgograd, and I have been living in St. Petersburg for already 6 years. My profession is a Senior Specialist in Auditing and Monitoring Business Processes.

## Education
I graduated from Volgograd State Technical University as an engineer, «Automatisation of technological processes» in 2010. I finished design courses last year. I have several certificates from Stepik. Currently I am taking the RS School Front-end course.

## Why I got interested in programming?
At the age of 14, I found a book about HTML. I read it at once. I made several websites, learned a little design, and I even started studying the back-end (PHP, MySQL), but 22 years ago this area wasn't as developed as it is now in terms of learning opportunities and I was stuck in this field of Java Script and PHP. I didn’t have a mentor. And I didn’t even know about their existence. So I gave up at the age of 16, as far as I remember.

All these years I remembered about my lost passion and I thought it’s impossible to rush into this sphere again. But… In December, 2022, I accidently found the design courses. In the first time I saw Figma and it was wonderful. After that course I understood that I need more. I didn't want to design websites, I wanted to code website designs like I did as a teenager.

## What is my purpose of joining RS School?
I want to realize my childhood dream of becoming a programmer. As they say, it's never too late or better late than never.

So now I want to be a Front-end developer because I enjoy programming and I can read and understand documentation properly. I can even prove it to you. I can show you my submitted tasks on RSSchool and the marks.

*Show Cross-Check: Submitted tasks and stars*

So as you see, all reviewers gave me the high marks. We didn't argue at all. I like to do and complete tasks. I spend all my free time on programming.

## Jobs experience
So now I'm going to tell about jobs. My first position as an engineer was a Leading Metrology Engineer, then a Quality Specialist and Auditor. These jobs were in Volgograd. Now I am a Senior Specialist in Auditing and Monitoring Business Processes in Saint-Petersburg.

## One of my many duties on my present job is...
checking the websites of the company. As an auditor, I check the relevance of the documentation of our products on the website: design documentation, certificates, user manuals, etc. Also I help with Search engine optimization (SEO).

And now I have a project to create a knowledge base for my organization on Bitrix. 

## My hobbies
- programming, coding
- UX/UI-design
- languages
- photography
- playing guitar, electrical guitar
- driving

## Final phrase
I remembered my childhood passion and this time I'm going to finish my goal.
