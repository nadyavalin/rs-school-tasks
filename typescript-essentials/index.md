## Reflections

1. *In the first module* **Getting Started with TypeScript** I gained an understanding of the benefits of using TypeScript in web development compared to JavaScript. TypeScript offers several advantages, such as static typing, which allows for better code organization, catching errors at compile-time rather than runtime, and improved code maintainability. One practical skill I acquired in this module was setting up TypeScript in Visual Studio Code using the "tsc" command. I learned how to add files into workspace in VSCode. I created TS file, added tsconfig.json, made settings in it to add the area for JS files.

2. *In the second module* **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript** I remembered how to declare variables using ***let*** and ***const***. I learned how to declare typed variables using primitive, object, union, intersection types in TypeScript. I remembered the subtypes ***boolean***, ***number***, ***bigInteger***, ***string***, ***array***. I learned how to create an ***enum***. Additionally, I understood the distinction between ***any*** and ***unknown*** types. I also delved into type ***assertion*** and gained knowledge about ***literal*** and ***collection*** types. I comprehended the concept of ***Tuples*** in TypeScript. By utilizing these types effectively, I can create more concise and readable code.

3. *In the third module* **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript** Now I know what an interface is and reasons for using it, and how it is different from a type alias. I learned how to declare, instantiate, extend and implement an interface. Also now I can declare an interface with custom array types. Furthermore, I can create indexable types. By implementing interfaces, I can ensure that my code follows a consistent and predictable structure, making it easier to maintain and debug. I think this knowledge will help me with the API task.

4. *In the fourth module* **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript** I learned how to create functions in TypeScript. I remembered about the named, anonymous and arrows functions. I wrote functions that have required, optional, default, and rest parameters. Also I can write the function with deconstructed object parameters. I can define function types using type aliases or interfaces.

5. *In the fifth module* **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript** I learned how to use TypeScript classes describe the shape of objects. I can declare and instantiate a class and apply access modifiers to a class. I can define static properties in a class. I learned how to declare a class that extends another class. Now I know how to declare an interface to ensure class shape. I know when to use an interface or when to use a class (to define the structure of an object). I knew about classes and constructors when I learned OOP in JavaScript, but now I know how to do it using TypeScript.

6. *In the sixth module* **Generics in TypeScript** I learned what generics are. It was difficult to understand and I need more practice of course. Now I have a kind of understanding how to identify use cases for generics. I learned how to define a generic function. I can declare a generic interface and generic class. I can implement generic constraints.

7. *In the seventh module* **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript** I learned how to work with External Libraries in TypeScript using the example of the dotenv library. Now I know how to import an external type library and organize my code using modules. I remember how to properly import and export modules when I was learning JavaScript. I realized that in TypeScript this process is almost the same as in JavaScript.

8. *In the eighth module* **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript** I learned about namespaces. I learned how to implement multi-file and single-file namespaces. Now I know the purpose of namespaces and the design considerations for using namespaces and modules. I am going to use only modules because modules offer some additional benefits that namespaces don't. All frameworks are structured using the concept of modules.

In the end of this journey I got the last [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/67239660/YVHLJCBR?sharingId=C0E00C5750816ACC) because now I can **Build JavaScript applications using TypeScript**.
