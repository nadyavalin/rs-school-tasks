## Reflections

1. *In the first module* **Getting Started with TypeScript** I learned how TypeScript is an improvement over JavaScript for web development. I set up TypeScript into Visual Studio Code (tsc). I learned how to add files into workspace in VSCode. I created TS file, added tsconfig.json, made settings in it to add the area for JS files.

2. *In the second module* **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript** I memorized how to declare variables using ***let*** and ***const***. I learned how to declare typed variables using primitive, object, union, intersection types in TypeScript. I memorized the subtypes ***boolean***, ***number***, ***bigInteger***, ***string***, ***array***. I learned how to create an ***enum***. Additionally, I understood the distinction between ***any*** and ***unknown*** types. I also delved into type ***assertion*** and gained knowledge about ***literal*** and ***collection*** types. I comprehended the concept of ***Tuples*** in TypeScript.
